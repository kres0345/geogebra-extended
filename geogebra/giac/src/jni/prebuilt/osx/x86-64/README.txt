These binaries are own built versions of gmp-5.1.2 and mpfr-3.1.2. They
have been compiled under Mac OS X 10.9 (64 bit) by using the --with-pic
option: first gmp have to be compiled and then mpfr (by using it).

The --with-pic option is mandatory.

TODO: add automatic download of these .a files into the Gradle build.
