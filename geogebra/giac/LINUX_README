This short tutorial explains how to create a command line driven Linux
version of Giac. The steps below have been tested under Linux Mint 17.2,
Ubuntu Linux 14.04 16.04 and 18.04.

Prerequisites
-------------

Install the packages build-essential, libgmp-dev and libmpfr-dev.

Compilation and running
-----------------------

1. Enter

   $ ../gradlew run

2. After a successful compilation you should see something like

   Press CTRL-D to stop
   > Building 85% > :run

   Here you can type some examples and exit with CTRL-D.

Troubleshooting
---------------

You may want to remove the line "include giac-android" from the file
settings.gradle in order to avoid installing the whole Android SDK.
Also remove the tasks "androidCopyCrystaxSo" and "androidAar" from
the file build.gradle.

Debugging in an IDE
-------------------

Use CLion to import the file CMakeLists.txt. Then put breakpoints to
various points you like (you may start with minigiac.cc).
