# Geogebra-extended
A fork I made of Geogebra. Currently the only new feature it has, is Comic Sans mode.

### Setup

To setup this project, follow the tutorial at https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/SetUp.

If you can't get it to work, then I will do my best to help set it up, just open an issue :)



### Features

- #### Comic Sans

To enabled `Comic Sans`, select `Settings` --> `Advanced` --> Scroll to the button, there you'l see `Enable Comic Sans`.

- #### LAN Sessions

I am planning to create a feature to allow the user to connect to another user and interact with Geogebra real-time, but right now I am still "studying" the source code to figure out where (and how) to implement it

### Building

- #### Windows

Navigate to `geogebra` in command-line(where `gradlew.bat` is at).

Then type `gradlew.bat :desktop:run`

- #### Mac OS

Not too sure about this one, look at the link mentioned above in setup, that will tell you how

- ##### Linux

The same goes for linux(as Mac)
