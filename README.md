# GeoGebra-extended
This is the repository of GeoGebra-Extended.

### Setup

To setup this project, follow the step-by-step guide [#Building](below) at https://dev.geogebra.org/trac/wiki/SetUp.

If you can't get it to work, then I will do my best to help set it up, just open an issue :)



### Features

- #### Comic Sans

To enabled `Comic Sans`, select `Settings` --> `Advanced` --> Scroll to the bottom, there you'l see `Enable Comic Sans`.

- #### LAN Sessions (Planned)

I am planning to create a feature to allow the user to connect to another user and interact with Geogebra real-time, but right now I am still "studying" the source code to figure out where (and how) to implement it

### Building

- #### Windows

Navigate to `geogebra` in command-line(where `gradlew.bat` is at).

Then type `gradlew.bat :desktop:run`

- #### Mac OS & Linux

Not too sure about these, take a look at the link mentioned above in setup. There is a guide to getting it running, it should not be different from this version.
